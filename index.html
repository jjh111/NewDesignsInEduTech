<h1>A Personal Computer to Support New Approaches to Education</h1>
<h2>As we may draw, using sketching to learn programmatic concepts - Building a Dynabook with Drawing As a Primary Interface</h2>

<h3>ABSTRACT:</h3>
<p>
Can we use sketching into computers to help teach concepts of logic? 
Can we create an environment where young children can organically discover how to realize their imaginations in computers? 

The modern computer is an incredible metamedium, a device capable of simulating most previous media forms, from photography, drawing, video, audio, etc. Yet modern devices are not designed to teach their users how to better understand computers and concepts in programming; instead modern devices are consumer-centric, focusing on reducing friction to transactional actions. 

What kind of computer do we want for education.

I propose a forwarding of Alan Kay's Dynabook concept updated with new research into sketch-based learning and creation tools. I contend that the Dynabook idea, that each child should have access to a personal dynamic medium in which they can instantiate their unique vision and share that vision with the world, has not been fulfilled. However, the pieces are in place today in consumer technology to begin creating a version of the dynabook that would forward and upgrade the original thinking behind Kay's experiments in SmallTalk. 

This document consists of 4 sections and a conclusion. Rich media will be mixed in. All sources are sited in the bibliography, as well as hyperlinked inline for useful context.
